# System X Requirements (v0.5) â€” Reorganized

The consolidated requirements draft has been decomposed into chapter-specific documents under [`docs/requirements/`](docs/requirements/README.md). Each numbered folder contains the content that previously appeared in this monolithic file, preserving section ordering so we can review and iterate per chapter during the phase-one definition work.

Use the directory index to navigate to the desired topic:

1. Vision & Goals (`docs/requirements/01_vision/`)
2. Stakeholders (`docs/requirements/02_stakeholders/`)
3. Scope (`docs/requirements/03_scope/`)
4. User & Use Cases (`docs/requirements/04_users/`)
5. Functional Requirements (`docs/requirements/05_functional/`)
6. Non-Functional Requirements (`docs/requirements/06_non_functional/`)
7. Data & Information Architecture (`docs/requirements/07_data_architecture/`)
8. Interfaces & Integrations (`docs/requirements/08_integrations/`)
9. UX Principles & Views (`docs/requirements/09_ux/`)
10. Governance & Safety Rails (`docs/requirements/10_governance/`)
11. Risks & Mitigations (`docs/requirements/11_risks/`)
12. Roadmap & Releases (`docs/requirements/12_roadmap/`)
13. Requirement Backlog (`docs/requirements/13_backlog/`)
14. Acceptance Criteria Patterns (`docs/requirements/14_acceptance/`)
15. Glossary (`docs/requirements/15_glossary/`)
16. References (`docs/requirements/16_references/`)

The original change log and reconciliation notes now live in `docs/requirements/00_meta/`.
