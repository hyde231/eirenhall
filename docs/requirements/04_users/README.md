# User & Use Cases

## Primary Persona
Privacy-first power user/developer running a home lab.

## Priority Use Cases
Code tasks/PRs; repo maintenance; file operations; knowledge recall; remote quick tasks (queueing captures, link retrieval, archival prep while off-LAN); GPU jobs; GTD; **link capture**; **archival + enrichment**; extensible plugins; unified query; bulk operations; **versioned captures per URL**; offline exports.

## Sample Stories
- Paste URL → offline archived Item (with timestamped local copy; warmed in hot cache when recent/favorited).
- Saved search for “updates this week” (first-class saved search entity available across desktop/mobile).
- Export Household-safe Markdown bundle.
- Desktop-first collection curation session while automation defers heavy storage/GPU workloads to scheduled windows.

## Milestone Emphasis
- **M1:** deliver generic document management, GTD task handling, and wiki-like knowledge storage as the baseline user value.

## Operational Notes
- Hot cache surfaces recent/favorite/priority documents while remote; mass-storage servers can be woken over LAN when deep archives are needed.
