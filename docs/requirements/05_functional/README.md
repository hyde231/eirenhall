## 5.3 Capture, Archival & Enrichment

| ID | Title | Description | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-014 | Link capture & normalization | Ingest URLs; assign realm; create **time-stamped local copy** | Must | Paste URL â†’ archived artifact with canonical URL + capture timestamp |

## 5.4 Search, Collections & Bulk Ops

| ID | Title | Description | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-018 | Unified query | Full-text + facets (type, realm, tags, date, **capture version/time**) | Must | p95 < 800ms; facet counts consistent |
| FR-019 | Bulk operations | Mass-tagging, realm move (down-scope by default), export static sets | Should | Dry-run; audited; undo |
| FR-020 | Dynamic & static collections | Saved dynamic (query-backed) and static (snapshot/export) | Must | Views auto-refresh; exports reproducible |
